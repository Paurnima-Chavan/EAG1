# 🧠 Smart Study Scheduler – Agentic Edition

This is an intelligent, multi-layered study planner built using **Agentic Architecture** principles.  
It simulates human-like reasoning using four modular layers:

- 👁️ Perception: Understand user input and preferences
- 🧠 Memory: Store and recall user preferences
- 🧭 Decision-Making: Plan the schedule using reasoning and constraints
- ⚙️ Action: Format and present the personalized study plan
